 Documentation: YESBANK Stock Price Prediction (Last 2 Years)
1. Introduction

This project predicts the YESBANK stock closing price using machine learning models. The workflow includes data preprocessing, visualization, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and future forecasting. Models used are Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Linear Regression.

2. Data Loading (use yfinance api )

 The dataset YESBANK_last2years_renamed.csv contains the following columns:

 Date

 Open

 High

 Low

 Close

 Volume

3. Data Preprocessing

 Checked dataset dimensions, missing values, and data types.

 Outliers were identified using boxplots for features: Close, High, Low, Open, and Volume.

 Outliers were handled using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method by clipping values within acceptable bounds.

4. Data Visualization

 A line chart was created to show the trend of closing prices over 2 years.

 A correlation heatmap was generated to show relationships between numerical variables (Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume).

5. Feature Engineering

 Converted the Date column into datetime format.

 Created a Date_ordinal column to represent dates numerically.

 Introduced technical indicators to enrich the dataset:

 Simple Moving Average (SMA): Calculated averages of the closing price over windows of 10 and 50 days, to smooth trends.

 Relative Strength Index (RSI): A momentum indicator (14-day) measuring speed and change of price movements, with values ranging between 0 and 100.

 Final input features:

 Date_ordinal

 Open

 High

 Low

 Volume

 SMA (10-day, 50-day)

 RSI (14-day)

 Target variable:

 Close

6. Feature Scaling

 MinMax scaling was applied to both input features and the target variable.

 Scaling ensured that all values, including SMA and RSI, were normalized between 0 and 1, which is important for machine learning algorithms.

7. Train-Test Split

 Dataset was divided into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets.

 This separation allowed unbiased evaluation of model performance.

8. Model Training and Evaluation
 Random Forest Regressor

 Trained with 200 estimators.

 Evaluation metrics: R² Score, MAE, RMSE.

 Visualized actual vs. predicted close prices.

Decision Tree Regressor

 Trained with default parameters.

 Evaluated using R² Score, MAE, RMSE.

 Linear Regression

  Trained on scaled data.

 Evaluated using R² Score, MAE, RMSE.

9. Future Forecasting (Till 25-12-2025)

 Future dates were generated beyond the last available date up to 25th December 2025.

 Last known OHLCV values were reused for future rows.

 Date_ordinal values were computed for these dates.

 SMA and RSI were excluded for future projections (since they require rolling windows), but the trained models could still predict based on available features.

 Predictions were made using all three models and inverse transformed to the original scale.

 Plots compared historical vs. forecasted closing prices, and the closing price predicted for 25-12-2025 was highlighted.

10. Model Saving and Loading

 Models saved with pickle for reuse:

 Random Forest → mini_stock.pkl

 Linear Regression → mini_stock_linear.pkl

 Decision Tree → mini_stock_tree.pkl

Scalers saved as:

 scaler_X.pkl

 scaler_Y.pkl

Reloaded models were used successfully for forecasting.
